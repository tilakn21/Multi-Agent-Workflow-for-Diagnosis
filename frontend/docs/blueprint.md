## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark charcoal gray (#1F1F1F) for the background to create a modern and clean aesthetic.
- Secondary color: Vibrant turquoise-green (#2EC1B1) for interactive elements, highlights, and the logo, providing a glowing effect.
- Accent color: White (#FFFFFF) and light grey (#D3D3D5) for text and icons to ensure readability and a minimalist design.
- Font: 'Poppins', a clean, geometric sans-serif font, for a modern feel. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use minimalist icons for chat input (microphone, send button) and app navigation to maintain a clean and intuitive interface.
- Implement a chat-style layout with dark grey bubbles for chatbot messages and lighter grey bubbles for user messages, both with rounded corners.
- Use subtle animations for the splash screen logo, transitions between questions, highlighting selected areas on the 3D model, and real-time response of the pain scale.
